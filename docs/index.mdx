# ðŸ“Œ Repinned

## Overview

Primitive to build simple and flexible sticky React header components

## Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install --save repinned
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add repinned
```

## How It Works

The library exposes 3 different pin states in relation to the scrolling state of parent container, i.e.
* `unfixed` - container has scrolled to the top
* `unpinned` - container is scrolling down
* `pinned` - container is scrolling up

## Use Cases

Common use cases of Repinned involve widgets that hide when user scrolls down and display when user scrolls up, e.g.

* Sticky header
* Sticky "Back to Top" button
