# Recipes

## Basic Styling

You should apply the following basic styles to your header component based on the state prop received.

* `unfixed` - position: static
* `unpinned` - position: sticky/fixed and transform: translateY(-100%)
* `pinned` - position: sticky/fixed

## Sticky or Fixed

Using `position: fixed` for `pinned`/`unpinned` state is a bit tricky as element with fixed position does not contribute to the height of the container/window.

This way, when switching from `position: static` to `position: fixed`, the overall page height changes, affecting the scoll position.

To work around this, you have to wrap your header component and assign the height of your header to it, e.g.

```jsx
<Repinned>
  {({ setRef, height, state }) => (
    <div style={{ height }}>
      <FixedHeader innerRef={setRef} state={state} />
    </div>
  )}
</Repinned>
```

The same does not apply to `position: sticky`, hence you can safely ignore the height provided.

Ref: [Can I Use?](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky)

```jsx
<Repinned>
  {({ setRef, state }) => (
    <StickyHeader innerRef={setRef} state={state} />
  )}
</Repinned>
```

## Animation

If you'd like to add CSS animation to your header for smoother pinning/unpinning, Repinned exposes `shouldAnimate` in the render function.

This value is only set to `true` if the state switches from `pinned` to `unpinned` or vice-versa.

This helps prevent the header from jumping when switching from `unfixed` to `unpinned` during initial scrolling as we will be animating on `transform` attribute.

The transition would happen from `unfixed` with `transform: none` or `translateY(0)` to `unpinned` with `transform: translateY(-100)`.

Hence it's necessary not to enable transition during this switch.
